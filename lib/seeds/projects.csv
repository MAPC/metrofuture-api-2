The goals of the project include creating shared knowledge around the current conditions of the Malden River, and to spur an interest in changing regulatory obstacles to developing welcoming public spaces.
Along with the City of Malden, MAPC will team up with the Malden Redevelopment Authority, Friends of the Malden River, and the Mystic River Watershed Association to fully realize the projectŐs goals. The creative placemaking installation is slated to occur in October 2019.",,Active,
Grand Junction Path Benefits,In Progress,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",Single Municipality,City of Cambridge,,,,,,,,,"The completion of a fully-interconnected Grand Junction Greenway will produce transportation, economic, and health-related benefits to the residents, workers, and visitors of Cambridge and its surrounding communities. The first step in achieving this vision may be the design and construction of a link in Kendall Square on the existing MassDOT right-of-way from Main Street to Cambridge Street. However, to support this important expansion, further insight that quantifies the benefits associated with adding this segment to the regional bike network is needed.

Accordingly, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) has identified the following three tasks as ways to recognize and evaluate a selection of these envisioned benefits: a case study analysis of three recent nationwide examples of similar path construction, development of a tool that would allow for an estimate of the additional destinations accessible with the addition of the Grand Junction Path, and an estimate of bicycling demand for the path.",,Active,

Climate Vulnerability and Resiliency Indicators,In Progress,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",MAPC Region-Wide,,,,,,,,,,"The impacts of climate change are not distributed equally. People may have vulnerabilities to different types of climate change impacts depending on their age, health status, location, access to transportation, and experience with systemic barriers wrought by discrimination. Conversely, communities can be resilient to climate change impacts due to their social networks, economic privileges, government supports, and more. As such, climate vulnerability and resiliency are inextricably tied to one another: people can have vulnerabilities in certain areas yet be resilient in others. Likewise, businesses and cultural institutions may have strategies to withstand some climate impacts but may be at risk for others. 
This project will assess the multidimensional vulnerabilities that different populations face through a scan of relevant literature and existing tools, and the development of a set of Greater Boston vulnerability indices. The vulnerability indices will help MAPC identify municipalities and communities that may be most likely to experience negative impacts due to climate changeŃspecifically flooding and excessive heatŃso that we can focus our own efforts to support those areas. It will also allow municipalities, community organizations, and constituents to understand the spatial nuances of climate vulnerability in their own municipalities or neighborhoods. The indices will be framed with accompanying information to explain why certain indicators were used in the analysis, and to highlight the practices and policies that can help bolster a communityŐs resilience in the face of acute climate events and long-term climate changes.
In order to better serve, advocate for/with, and plan for/with climate vulnerable populations and businesses in the Greater Boston region, this project aims to develop a dynamic, nuanced, and interactive tool for identifying climate vulnerable populations and commercial areas and highlighting areas of climate resiliency. Importantly, we aim for the tool and accompanying analyses to be guided by the voices of the most vulnerable: external engagement with stakeholders in communities at various levels of climate vulnerability and resiliency will ground-truth our analyses and allow us to collect local information and stories. Ultimately, these resources aim to provide the type of holistic, equity-driven analyses needed to more quickly develop inclusive and effective climate change strategies at the regional, subregional, and municipal level.",,Active,
Building energy consumption/demand and GHGs - MetroCommon 2050,In Progress,Data Services,"Perkins-High, Lily",MAPC Region-Wide,,,,,,,,,,"According to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental ProtectionŐs 2015 update to the stateŐs greenhouse gas inventory, 28% of emissions in Massachusetts come from residential and commercial buildings and 21% come from consumption in the electricity sector. It is essential that MAPC better understand greenhouse gas emissions resulting from buildings, yet, the utility data that is publicly available is not granular enough to do so. At present, utility data is only available at the municipal level, and is only disaggregated by residential and commercial/industrial sectors.  Data may not be available all together for smaller communities, where information is protected for customer privacy. 

This project will focus on gaining access to historical electricity and natural gas utility data through municipal electric and natural gas utility providers. If the project team is able to obtain municipal utility data, they will review and catalogue it, and try to attach it to parcel records for future use at MAPC. They will also share the information with the Boston University Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) as a dataset that can help expand the Climate Free Boston energy model to a regional energy model. If the project team is unable to obtain utility data, it will focus on other avenues to advance MAPCŐs understanding of building energy consumption, such as additional sources of non-aggregated and aggregated utility data.",,Active,

Dockless Bikeshare - MetroCommon 2050 Research Agenda,In Development,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",Multiple Municipalities,,,,,,,,,,"Spurred by technologic innovation, a new wave of bikeshare systems has rapidly spread across the United States. Dockless bikeshare systems, which permit cyclists to pick-up and drop-off bikes in a defined service area, were formally introduced to the Boston region in April 2018 when Lime deployed 1,500 bikes. This dockless system supports cycling as an active travel option in several inner core communities not served by the regionŐs dock-based system, Blue Bikes, which has progressively expanded service since its introduction in July 2011. Together, these distinct bikeshare systems are quickly becoming integrated within the regionŐs established transportation landscape, which will continue to be redesigned as new shared-mobility options (e.g., dockless scooters, electric-bikes) are introduced. The study of travel patterns of cyclists using this new dockless system, which facilitates a bicycle redistribution that more closely matches supply and demand, presents a unique opportunity to recognize how more sustainable demand-responsive mobility options may be complementing rapid transit services and building a resilient multimodal transportation network.",,Active,
Municipal Workforce and Leadership - MetroCommon 2050,In Progress,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",MAPC Region-Wide,,,,,,,,,,"Metro Boston is becoming an older, more diverse region. By 2030 nearly a million Baby Boomers in Metro Boston will have retired from their jobs. As they retire, younger workers will need to fill vacant positions. This turnover presents both challenges and opportunities for municipalities. The Baby Boomer generation currently makes up 40% of Metro BostonŐs workforce, and likely just as much, if not more, of municipal workforces, so there will be a lot of jobs to fill as Baby Boomers continue to retire. At the same time, younger generations of workers in Metro Boston (and the nation) are increasingly diverse by race, ethnicity, and country of birth. As municipalities fill jobs vacated by Baby Boomers, they have the opportunity to build a workforce that reflects the growing diversity of the region and of the municipality they serve. These demographic changes, and the way local governments respond to these shifts, may substantially influence the operation of municipalities and the policies that they enact. This begs the following questions: What are the current demographics of Metro BostonŐs municipal workforce and leadership? How will an aging and more diverse labor force impact the makeup of local governments? And how are governments thinking about these trends and potential impacts? To begin addressing these questions, this project will assess existing municipal workforce demographic data and reports from local, state, and federal government agencies, and provide a memo describing the findings. We will also begin to develop a survey instrument to be used in the next phase of this research to gather primary data on municipal workforce demographics in the Metro Boston region. This work will inform future research into municipal diversity and representation throughout the Boston region.",,Active,

To gain a greater understanding of the definitions, mechanisms, and analyses of commercial displacement at local and regional scales, a review of the commercial displacement literature (from government agencies and civil society/academia) will be conducted and documented. This research will inform efforts to better understand and measure displacement and displacement risk in Metro Boston, and to begin a repository for potential policy interventions and best practices to mitigate risks and negative impacts of commercial displacement.",,Active,
Electric Vehicle Adoption Patterns and Predictors - MetroCommon 2050 Research Agenda,In Progress,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",State-Wide,,,,,,,,,,"Electrification of the vehicle fleet is a fundamental strategy required to achieve substantial transportation-related GHG reductions by 2040 and 2050. Increasing the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) by resident households is a major component of that electrification motivation. Unfortunately, limited evidence exists on what factors, specific to an individual or surrounding context, contribute to the purchase of an EV. Using a unique data set that enumerates every passenger vehicle purchased in Massachusetts, this research proposes to detect these factors and provide an overview of hybrid and EV market penetration in the Greater Boston region and beyond. Research project findings are intended to guide scenario modeling efforts of the regional plan update and inform a legislative goal to reduce transportation emissions by having 300,000 zero emission vehicles on Massachusetts roadways by 2025.",,Active,
The Changing Nature of Work - MetroCommon 2050 Research Agenda,In Progress,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",MAPC Region-Wide,,,,,,,,,,"Greater BostonŐs Industries and occupations in have changed significantly over the last 25 years. Incomes have become more and more polarized, in large part due to shifting industry and occupation trends. There are fewer middle-wage occupations in the region now, and more low-wage and high-wage occupations. These trends are consistent around the nation, though Metro Boston has its own industry and occupational trends that make it unique (and in some senses, better off than much of the rest of the country.) To better understand the divers and impacts of these changes, possible future changes, and policies and programs needed for workers today and in the future, Data Services is conducting a review of existing MAPC research on the topic as well as literature from academia, government agencies, industry, and think tanks about the changing nature of work.

Housing Data and Submarket Typologies - MetroCommon 2050,In Progress,Data Services,"Partridge, Jessie",MAPC Region-Wide,,,,,,,,,,"MAPC has more housing market data than ever before. From our internal Rental Listings and MassBuilds databases to our CoStar business listing data subscription, our data resources can help us answer critical questions about the housing market in the Metro Boston region. What opportunities exist for households of different types and different incomes in the many submarkets and locations across the region?  How do different types of housing development impact housing costs in surrounding neighborhoods? Where are evictions concentrated and contributing to severe housing instability? How has housing and rental affordability changed over time? What are the right housing policy and programmatic interventions to advance in different types of housing submarkets? These kinds of questions are central to many of the critical housing challenges Greater Boston is facing, and there may be more questions that emerge from the data. 

Before we set out to answer these questions, we must first understand the capabilities, limitations, and nuances of the data sources we have available. To that end, Data Services will conduct a thorough data assessment of several housing databases at our disposal. We will produce succinct and useful documentation for each data source that describes the data and the methods of its collection, outlines the dataŐs possibilities and limitations, defines the variables in the data, and illustrates how the data could be used to answer various research questions, or how it could inform local and subregional planning efforts. The resulting documentation will help us determine what research questions we can answer now, as well as the questions that may require alternative approaches (such as primary data collection). Ultimately, we intend for this documentation to serve as an indispensable resource for MAPC researchers and planners looking to take advantage of the plethora of housing data we now possess.

Once all this data is documented and organized, we will use it, along with other readily available data, to classify the MAPC region into housing submarkets. An analysis of housing submarketsŃwhich will use statistical methods to classify similar areas in the region based on housing, economic, transportation, and demographic characteristicsŃwill be valuable in several ways. It will set a framework for future housing research to be able to focus in on a particular submarket or submarkets with characteristics that are relevant to specific housing inquiriesŃsuch as mapping populations vulnerable to displacement or assessing the equitable distribution of affordable housing development. It will also allow us to target policy responses tailored to specific types of places facing particular challenges.

West Station Area Transit Study,In Progress,Transportation,"Pollack, Travis",Multiple Municipalities,Barr Foundation,,,,,,,,,"MassDOT is currently planning the replacement of the I-90 viaduct in Allston and the existing interchange of I-90 with Cambridge Street and Soldiers Field Road (Exit 20). The MassDOT project will replace existing highway ramps with an urban interchange and street system that will facilitate the ultimate redevelopment of Beacon Park Yards Đ a former rail yard Đ into a (currently undefined) mixed-use development. Harvard University owns the majority of the land within the project study area, but has not yet proposed plans for its future development. The ultimate buildout of the area is expected to be of significant size and scope, and MassDOT, the Cities of Boston and Cambridge, and the Town of Brookline would all like to maximize the future use of non-auto forms of transportation for trips that start or end in Beacon Park Yards, and for regional trips that travel through Allston to access major employment centers in Harvard Square, Kendall Square, Longwood Medical Area, and Downtown Boston.

Included in the interchange project is the addition of a multi-modal bus and commuter rail station within Beacon Park Yards referred to as ŇWest Station.Ó MassDOT and MBTA are committing to designing and building the West Station, with financial support from area property owners, once development of a sufficient amount to warrant its utility occurs in Beacon Park Yards and nearby population and employment centers . 

The purpose of MAPC's West Station Area Transit study is to provide municipal and state government, as well as the development community, with an objective evaluation of the strategies that could best improve non-auto accessibility to jobs, labor, housing, healthcare, and other major destinations under different potential development futures for the Beacon Park Yards area. The results of this study will help municipal and state governments to proactively plan for and implement regional mobility improvements as Beacon Park Yards and surrounding areas are developed. A direct outcome of this Study will be transit service concepts that MassDOT can use to inform the design of the new West Station so it supports the type of transit service that will meet the accessibility and non-auto mode share goals identified by this study. 

Study Questions:
Ą Which transit connections and service levels might attract the most riders?
Ą What is the best sequencing of development and transit improvements?
Ą How might pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, as well as on-demand mobility services, impact travel behavior?
Ą What transit and land use policies and regulations might be most effective?

North Reading Satellite Shuttle Study,In Progress,Transportation,"Pollack, Travis",Single Municipality,Town of North Reading,,,,,,,,,"This project will conduct a feasibility study for a shuttle connecting a satellite park and ride lot in North Reading with MBTA commuter rail service in Wilmington or Reading. The purpose of the shuttle would be to better connect the residents of North Reading to MBTA services, which also potentially connecting workers to jobs in North Reading. Finally, a shuttle service could provide relief for overcrowded parking at the Wilmington or Reading stations. The study will examine the existing commuting trends for North Reading, to determine whether the data show that connecting to commuter rail via satellite parking site might be warranted now or be needed in future. The study will also review and rank locations in North Reading for a park and ride lot,  based upon information such as ownership, possible lease, and maintenance costs, distance to commuter rail and overall accessibility for the town residents. The study will include a range of potential ridership, based upon similar satellite shuttles operations in the Boston region. Finally, the study will include potential construction costs for the satellite lot, based upon other recent parking construction and lease costs in the area, as well as possible shuttle operating costs, using data from similar operations in the region. 

Previous plans and studies that recognized the need for better transit include the TownŐs 2004 Master Plan, which identified a lack of public transportation and paratransit as a problem in the Town; a recent survey conducted by the Boston North Regional Coordinating Council which identified North Reading as having particularly difficult transportation challenges, as well as the 2017 North Reading senior and paratransit study. Additionally, the North Suburban Planning Council through the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) completed a suburban mobility study to address the transportation needs of all residents.

The research is looking at whether the VMT changes are part of shift in overall travel behavior with more drivers and greater auto ownership with economic growth, or is mostly an effect of more ride-hailing services and food/parcel deliveries. Similarly, congestion pricing has been implemented in several highway corridors in the US and in urban areas across the globe as a way to make vehicular traffic more efficient, minimize air and noise quality impacts of vehicular traffic, and raise revenues for transportation infrastructure. Recently, cities have begun to investigate whether documented increases in VMT and congestion in urban areas are related to an increase in ride-hailing and delivery services, and whether congestion pricing might be a policy to mitigate these VMT/congestion impacts.",,Active,

Public Health Impact: Community Speed Reduction,Completed,Public Health,"Keppard, Barry",State-Wide,"Health Resources in Action, Inc. (HRiA)",,,,,,,,,"Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths in the United States each year. In 2011, vehicle speed played a role in nearly one in three crash deaths, about ninety percent of which took place on non-Interstate roads. High speeds are especially dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists, who are disproportionately threatened by even small increases in traffic speed, when collisions occur. Poor road design, lack of enforcement, and speed limits that are set too high can encourage high speeds. Community-wide speed reduction strategies intervene in the built environment to slow down motor vehicles and are systematically applied within a defined geographic area.

Through a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MAPC partnered with Health Resources in Actoin (HRiA) to develop an evidence-based resource for speed reduction strategies, including designing and retrofitting road networks to ensure safe speeds, using automated traffic enforcement technologies, and reducing speed limits.  The purpose of the guide and associated materials was to provide a resource for communities implementing these strategies and seeking to prevent collisions, reduce fatalities and injuries, and makes streets more inviting for cycling and walking.",,Active,http://www.hria.org/resources/reports/2013-resources-speed-reduction/

Essex County Fire Chiefs Community Paramedicine,Completed,Municipal Collaboration,"Fine, Mark",Multiple Municipalities,,,,,,,,,,"During the past decade, demand for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provided by area fire departments has increased dramatically.  For exampleÉ In Essex County the requests for EMS responses has risen well over 122 % in the last ten years.  A large proportion of these service requests are however for non-emergency, but recurring, medical issues, such as the treatment of chronic disease.  Addressing such conditions with emergency care is considered wasteful.  Mobile integrated health/community paramedicine proposes a more cost-effective model with services tailored to those residents with recurrent but non-emergency needs.  Under a paramedicine program, a regional fire service creates a non-emergency medical service division (NEMS) providing a range of preventive and navigational interventions.  Such a model has been adopted successfully in Washington State, where the Kent Regional Fire Authority has created the FDCARES program. The Essex County Fire Chiefs Association proposes to examine the Kent model, and other relevant approaches, with an eye towards creating a similar service.

A major driver for this project is the financial pressures local fire departments face in maintaining quality EMS functions.  Service demand is increasing but costs are difficult to cover given budget pressures and reduced or unrecoverable insurance reimbursements.  Creating a mobile integrated health/community paramedicine program could help fill a gap in the medical response system, reduce the use of emergency response for addressing non-emergency conditions, while generating additional revenues to sustain local fire departmentsŐ emergency medical services.  

The project will develop business model options for community paramedicine, facilitate outreach to health care providers and recommend next steps for the Essex County Fire Chiefs to take in further developing a paramedicine program.",,Active,

The Life Science sector in Massachusetts continues to thrive, with the industry expanding at a double digit compounded annual growth rate despite the recession. Discoveries such as DNA and RNA sequencing are catalyzing the creation of thousands of jobs in the Commonwealth and across our nation. To fill ‰ŰŇ and retain ‰ŰŇ those jobs in Massachusetts there is a recognized need to train and retain students we educate here.  Advances in the field are also creating a need to re-train workers to operate and maintain the most important current and emerging bioinstrumentation. A related unmet industry need comes from the region‰ŰŞs early-stage biotech companies, the engine of future industry growth, which cannot afford the expensive new instrumentation needed to develop their innovations, increase their productivity and foster their growth. Similarly, our teaching colleges cannot afford to purchase such current advanced, industry-standard tools and therefore cannot graduate populations of students prepared to step into, and compete for, high quality Life Science jobs here. In recognition of these unmet needs, five North Shore institutions joined together to form the North Shore Biotech Consortium (the Consortium): Endicott College, Gordon College, Salem State University (SSU), North Shore Community College (NSCC), and North Shore InnoVentures, Inc. (NSIV), a non-profit business incubator. We believe our Consortium is the first of its kind in the nation, with its mission to educate the next generation of Life Science students and train them on the next generation instrumentation; improve placement of interns, graduates and workforce re-trainees in the region; and grow the region‰ŰŞs biotech sector.

MAPC worked with this group to develop a memorandum of understanding between Arlington and participating municipalities to document agreement on the terms of payment and delivery.

Businesses are vulnerable to both natural and man-made disasters, but businesses that have prepared and made recovery plans survive with comparatively minimal loss and/or disruption of productivity. Unfortunately, such planning does not happen regularly. According to the Small Business Administration, only 26 percent of small and medium-size businesses have disaster preparedness plans in place.  It is not surprising then that 40-60 percent of small businesses never reopen after a disaster.  Private sector entities therefore need to put in place processes to better ensure continuity and recovery.  The project culminated with business continuity workshops to assist small business owners in the development of disaster recovery plans, as well as educate them on banking and insurance options available to them.

Since the online version launched in the fall of 2013, over 20,000 surveys have been collected through the site. One of the schools involved in the early prototyping phase of the process has collected two rounds of surveys three years apart, and found a 10% increase in biking and walking mode share among students living within a half mile of the school, a 5% decrease in daily auto trips to and from school, and a 5.5% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions per student.
