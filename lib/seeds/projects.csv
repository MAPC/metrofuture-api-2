With nearly 90% of the properties surrounding the river zoned for industrial use, the Malden River is underutilized as a recreational space and is largely inaccessible to the public.  
With a grant from MAPC’s Technical Assistance program along with in-kind contributions from the City of Malden, this project seeks to prioritize the Malden River as a public recreation site. Through a creative placemaking installation that includes maps, signage, and video, MAPC will lead an effort to demonstrate the sustainable redevelopment and public access potential of land areas adjacent to the Malden River. 
In addition to the graphic elements, a walking tour with City leaders and local residents will be organized to provide an overview of the historical and contemporary uses of the land area. The goals of the project include creating shared knowledge around the current conditions of the Malden River, and to spur an interest in changing regulatory obstacles to developing welcoming public spaces.
Along with the City of Malden, MAPC will team up with the Malden Redevelopment Authority, Friends of the Malden River, and the Mystic River Watershed Association to fully realize the project’s goals.

Acquired by the Town of Medfield in 2014, the site is a unique and exciting terrain for creative reuse and renovation.  

Through MAPC’s Technical Assistance program, we aim to facilitate the activation of the campus with a placemaking activities that will set the course for future creative uses at the site. The strategy will involve activating the church which is slated to become the centerpiece of a future performing art center as well as the porches that grace the other buildings throughout the campus.

MAPC is working collaboratively with the Town of Medfield, the Cultural Alliance of Medfield, and an advisory committee composed of local residents and artists from Mefield and surrounding towns to plan a series of events starting on June 23rd, 2019 and continuing through May of 2020.

Covering 14 communities across Metro Boston, Keep Cool provides residents with a resource to find places for keeping cool this summer. This initiative will increase awareness on the effects of climate change, and offer heat safety tips and information on emergency cooling centers during extreme heat events. Note: This is project is in beta (a work in progress), with ongoing efforts to find and display locations for cooling down. If you have any feedback, questions or find a cool place missing from this map, please email arouault@mapc.org.

The MMC seeks to prevent heat-related fatalities and illnesses, foster tighter intergenerational social networks, and develop data-driven tools to identify high-risk zones to help target interventions.

Climate change is exacerbating heat in the Metro Boston area and will only worsen conditions in future years. In addition to taking steps to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions, the MMC is committed to leveraging tools like Keep Cool to advance climate preparedness in the region.

1) Seamless Docs: a third-party online permitting solution for street opening and trench permits, configured to municipal-specific workflows by MAPC.
2) RoadWorks: an MAPC-developed mapping tool to facilitate visualization of paving and other infrastructure plans for both municipalities and utilities. It automatically maps locations of permits and allows for easy manual entry of plan information.

The e-permitting platform will provide efficiencies for both municipalities, contractors and the gas company. RoadWorks will enable high quality coordination between the city or town and the gas company, which can help both parties synchronize projects to avoid costly and unsightly streetcuts and paving.

People may have vulnerabilities to different types of climate change impacts depending on their age, health status, location, access to transportation, and experience with systemic barriers wrought by discrimination. Conversely, communities can be resilient to climate change impacts due to their social networks, economic privileges, government supports, and more. As such, climate vulnerability and resiliency are inextricably tied to one another: people can have vulnerabilities in certain areas yet be resilient in others. Likewise, businesses and cultural institutions may have strategies to withstand some climate impacts but may be at risk for others. 
This project will assess the multidimensional vulnerabilities that different populations face through a scan of relevant literature and existing tools, and the development of a set of Greater Boston vulnerability indices. The vulnerability indices will help MAPC identify municipalities and communities that may be most likely to experience negative impacts due to climate change—specifically flooding and excessive heat—so that we can focus our own efforts to support those areas. It will also allow municipalities, community organizations, and constituents to understand the spatial nuances of climate vulnerability in their own municipalities or neighborhoods. The indices will be framed with accompanying information to explain why certain indicators were used in the analysis, and to highlight the practices and policies that can help bolster a community’s resilience in the face of acute climate events and long-term climate changes.
In order to better serve, advocate for/with, and plan for/with climate vulnerable populations and businesses in the Greater Boston region, this project aims to develop a dynamic, nuanced, and interactive tool for identifying climate vulnerable populations and commercial areas and highlighting areas of climate resiliency.

By 2030 nearly a million Baby Boomers in Metro Boston will have retired from their jobs. As they retire, younger workers will need to fill vacant positions. This turnover presents both challenges and opportunities for municipalities. The Baby Boomer generation currently makes up 40% of Metro Boston’s workforce, and likely just as much, if not more, of municipal workforces, so there will be a lot of jobs to fill as Baby Boomers continue to retire. At the same time, younger generations of workers in Metro Boston (and the nation) are increasingly diverse by race, ethnicity, and country of birth. As municipalities fill jobs vacated by Baby Boomers, they have the opportunity to build a workforce that reflects the growing diversity of the region and of the municipality they serve. These demographic changes, and the way local governments respond to these shifts, may substantially influence the operation of municipalities and the policies that they enact. This begs the following questions: What are the current demographics of Metro Boston’s municipal workforce and leadership? How will an aging and more diverse labor force impact the makeup of local governments? And how are governments thinking about these trends and potential impacts? To begin addressing these questions, this project will assess existing municipal workforce demographic data and reports from local, state, and federal government agencies, and provide a memo describing the findings.

From our internal Rental Listings and MassBuilds databases to our CoStar business listing data subscription, our data resources can help us answer critical questions about the housing market in the Metro Boston region. What opportunities exist for households of different types and different incomes in the many submarkets and locations across the region?  How do different types of housing development impact housing costs in surrounding neighborhoods? Where are evictions concentrated and contributing to severe housing instability? How has housing and rental affordability changed over time? What are the right housing policy and programmatic interventions to advance in different types of housing submarkets? These kinds of questions are central to many of the critical housing challenges Greater Boston is facing, and there may be more questions that emerge from the data. 

Before we set out to answer these questions, we must first understand the capabilities, limitations, and nuances of the data sources we have available. To that end, Data Services will conduct a thorough data assessment of several housing databases at our disposal. We will produce succinct and useful documentation for each data source that describes the data and the methods of its collection, outlines the data’s possibilities and limitations, defines the variables in the data, and illustrates how the data could be used to answer various research questions, or how it could inform local and subregional planning efforts. The resulting documentation will help us determine what research questions we can answer now, as well as the questions that may require alternative approaches (such as primary data collection). Ultimately, we intend for this documentation to serve as an indispensable resource for MAPC researchers and planners looking to take advantage of the plethora of housing data we now possess.

Once all this data is documented and organized, we will use it, along with other readily available data, to classify the MAPC region into housing submarkets. An analysis of housing submarkets—which will use statistical methods to classify similar areas in the region based on housing, economic, transportation, and demographic characteristics—will be valuable in several ways. It will set a framework for future housing research to be able to focus in on a particular submarket or submarkets with characteristics that are relevant to specific housing inquiries—such as mapping populations vulnerable to displacement or assessing the equitable distribution of affordable housing development. It will also allow us to target policy responses tailored to specific types of places facing particular challenges.

_ Identify publicly-available data sources that can be used to calculate the denominator (total municipal land area to be included in the calculation). Determine, among other issues, the following:
o Whether there is a data source thatshould be considered more “reliable” than another (i.e., MassGIS vs. local assessor’s data). It will be important to consider data sources to which all communities can have access in order to avoid putting some municipalities at a disadvantage by requiring the use of difficult-to-obtain data.
o Whether if local assessor’s data is used, which assessors’ codes apply.
o Which criteria are used to determine whether land zoned for residential, commercial or industrial purposes should be included.
o How un-zoned land should be properly considered.
o How the data should be applied. For instance, water bodies are excluded, but wetlands are not – so which GIS codes for water should be deductible?

It is distinguished from other municipalities in the Inner Core by its density and diversity of residents by race/ethnicity. The City has the greatest proportion of transit-dependent residents in Greater Boston and the most densely populated neighborhoods outside of the City of Boston. The 2010 population was $35,177; 75 percent of residents identify as a race other than white. All of the census tracts within the City of Chelsea meet the environmental justice criteria established by the federal government. The median household income is $47,291. Approximately 53 percent of households are housing cost-burdened; of this number, 28 percent spend between 30-50% of income on housing costs and 25 percent spend more than 40 percent of income on housing. Unemployment is 11 percent. (ACS 2009-2013 estimates)

The Silver Line Gateway project will extend MAPC silver line bus service from East Boston to Chelsea and is anticipated to serve 8,730 riders per day.  Project construction will extend from the Massachusetts Port Authority employee parking lot to Central Avenue and Eastern Avenue, ending at the Mystic Mall in Chelsea. The line will connect thousands of residents in Chelsea to growing employment opportunities in the Seaport District area of Boston. The project also includes construction of a greenway along a section of the transit line as part of the Commonwealth’s urban parks initiative, the Gateway Cities Parks Program. 

The route will begin at South Station in Boston, stopping at all of the existing Silver Line stations in the Seaport District, use the Ted Williams Tunnel and stop at the Airport Blue Line Station, use the new Coughlin Bypass Road, and then cross into Chelsea via the new Chelsea Street Bridge. West of Eastern Avenue, a new busway will be constructed along MassDOT-owned right-of-way (ROW), the former Grand Junction Railway, to the Mystic Mall.

It is a compact, quaint New England downtown that has many assets including several â€œMain Streetâ€ù style blocks, public transit options (commuter rail and bus), and a beautiful Town Common. However, as with many municipal centers across Massachusetts, Walpoleâ€™s downtown vitality and pedestrian activity has steadily diminished over the years as transportation routes, residential patterns, and shopping patterns changed. There is potential for the Town to vastly improve the area, but a vision is needed to guide future growth â€“ including a diversity of residential options, office and retail.

The subregional priority mapping process provided an opportunity to promote dialogue about land use issues that transcend municipal boundaries. Local perspectives are key to identifying areas where growth and development should be emphasized (priority development areas) as well as areas that should be preserved to protect natural resources and the character of each city and town (priority preservation areas).

The Life Science sector in Massachusetts continues to thrive, with the industry expanding at a double digit compounded annual growth rate despite the recession. Discoveries such as DNA and RNA sequencing are catalyzing the creation of thousands of jobs in the Commonwealth and across our nation. To fill â€“ and retain â€“ those jobs in Massachusetts there is a recognized need to train and retain students we educate here.  Advances in the field are also creating a need to re-train workers to operate and maintain the most important current and emerging bioinstrumentation. A related unmet industry need comes from the regionâ€™s early-stage biotech companies, the engine of future industry growth, which cannot afford the expensive new instrumentation needed to develop their innovations, increase their productivity and foster their growth. Similarly, our teaching colleges cannot afford to purchase such current advanced, industry-standard tools and therefore cannot graduate populations of students prepared to step into, and compete for, high quality Life Science jobs here. In recognition of these unmet needs, five North Shore institutions joined together to form the North Shore Biotech Consortium (the Consortium): Endicott College, Gordon College, Salem State University (SSU), North Shore Community College (NSCC), and North Shore InnoVentures, Inc. (NSIV), a non-profit business incubator. We believe our Consortium is the first of its kind in the nation, with its mission to educate the next generation of Life Science students and train them on the next generation instrumentation; improve placement of interns, graduates and workforce re-trainees in the region; and grow the regionâ€™s biotech sector.

Completion of the Regional Housing Plan and Regional Analysis of Impediments/ Fair Housing and Equity Assessment will refine our key policy and implementation priorities. These priorities will serve several purposes that include ensuring the equitable availability of housing throughout the region to all â€œprotected classesâ€ù; expanding the resources available for the production and preservation of affordable housing; assisting policymakers at the state and local levels in allocating housing assistance equitably and effectively; identifying housing opportunities for the private market; and facilitating alignment of the regionâ€™s housing resources with its anticipated needs going forward. Even while that planning is underway, the MA Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is updating a number of their housing programs and launching new ones.  

This work will enable MAPC and other members of the Consortium to collaborate with DHCD to improve and expand a number of critical housing programs. The goal is to shape these initiatives to place greater emphasis on location (e.g., developing in smart growth locations with infrastructure and public transportation access); to achieve greater efficiency of housing program (e.g., collaborating across municipal lines); to improve program effectiveness (e.g., more units produced); and to enhance equity outcomes (e.g., more units available and affordable to very low-income households and various protected classes).",,Active,Active,,Yes,,,,,,

MAPC worked with Winthrop to develop a route system of 3 routes throughout town, including one major route, the Ocean Route, which would be incorporated into the proposed regional greenway system.

The Ocean Route is proposed as the signature walking route that serves as the extension of the East Boston Greenway through Belle Isle Marsh to the beaches of Winthrop, ending at Deer Island. The route follows existing trails and walks along three beaches, as well as connected low traffic streets. The trail system will provide economic development to the town with increased tourism, and support for the new ferry service to Boston.

In addition to the WalkWinthrop greenway system, the implementation plan recommends steps forward for the Hubway bike share program, bicycle accommodation on town streets, and a â€œsafe routes to schoolsâ€ù program.

2)	E-democracy and e-voting
3)	Better local election dates and times

This project will seek to identify existing, underlying problems in local democratic practices, examine whether changes would expand participation in local government and improve governance, and develop and present the following:

•	Recommendations for innovations and improvements in the way Town Meetings operate in the sub-region.  These recommendations will include best practices from towns in MetroWest and may also look at ideas from Town Meetings conducted in other parts of Greater Boston and across the Commonwealth.

•	Recommendations for ways in which MetroWest towns can get traditionally underrepresented groups, including persons or color, youth, renters and linguistic minorities, more involved in local democratic activities.  These recommendations will include best practices and success stories from suburban communities in achieving greater participation from such populations.

•	A high-level review on how and where electronic voting methods and democratic engagement approaches have been incorporated into municipal government, with ideas for incorporating such technologies into town practices in MetroWest.

Public health programming beyond basic compliance activity is therefore difficult to provide and better health outcomes for area residents become harder to affect.  A potential response to these challenge and of enhancing current public health capacity is municipal collaboration.  To achieve this goal, the project will take the following tasks:

1)	Assessing public health services across area towns and comparing that with identified health needs and requirements. This work would gather information from existing sources, including relevant community health needs assessments and reporting from health departments and Board of Health, and collect community input. It would also analyze what public health services area hospitals are providing in order to better understand potential linkages to and support for local public health services; 
2)	Creating an inventory of area public health resources and services so communities can learn what is available to offer and share. The project would present other service examples based on ongoing local and regional public health work occurring in MA; 
3)	Examining what evidence-based services and best practices in regional public health collaboration could be adopted in Essex County/the North Shore; and

For example… In Essex County the requests for EMS responses has risen well over 122 % in the last ten years.  A large proportion of these service requests are however for non-emergency, but recurring, medical issues, such as the treatment of chronic disease.  Addressing such conditions with emergency care is considered wasteful.  Mobile integrated health/community paramedicine proposes a more cost-effective model with services tailored to those residents with recurrent but non-emergency needs.  Under a paramedicine program, a regional fire service creates a non-emergency medical service division (NEMS) providing a range of preventive and navigational interventions.  Such a model has been adopted successfully in Washington State, where the Kent Regional Fire Authority has created the FDCARES program. The Essex County Fire Chiefs Association proposes to examine the Kent model, and other relevant approaches, with an eye towards creating a similar service.

A major driver for this project is the financial pressures local fire departments face in maintaining quality EMS functions.  Service demand is increasing but costs are difficult to cover given budget pressures and reduced or unrecoverable insurance reimbursements.  Creating a mobile integrated health/community paramedicine program could help fill a gap in the medical response system, reduce the use of emergency response for addressing non-emergency conditions, while generating additional revenues to sustain local fire departments’ emergency medical services.  

The project will develop business model options for community paramedicine, facilitate outreach to health care providers and recommend next steps for the Essex County Fire Chiefs to take in further developing a paramedicine program.",,Active,Active,No,Yes,Yes,No,,,,No

Among the dozen original communities engaged with the feasibility study, Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop eventually requested the hired consultant to look specifically at the feasibility of a three community consolidated dispatch.

In September of 2010, the three communities received a report from the firm RCC Consultants, Inc. which concluded that Revereâ€™s public safety facility (the new Police Headquarters located along Revere Beach Parkway) was adequate to house a consolidated dispatch for the three communities with certain work space expansions and operational changes.

In early 2011, the three communities received District Local Technical Assistance funding to enable MAPC to assist in procurement of a project management firm to guide the communities into a consolidated dispatch.

The improved bicycle and pedestrian network will offer a place for people of all ages to exercise and provide safe, attractive facilities for non-motorized transport. The Watertown facilities will also provide important connections to local and regional businesses, parks, and other cultural amenities. The Town’s investments are intended to produce environmental, economic, and health-related benefits to the Town’s residents, workers, and visitors. To capture these changes and to support future projects, measurement of pre-intervention levels of active transportation – walking and biking – in Watertown are needed.

Poor road design, lack of enforcement, and speed limits that are set too high can encourage high speeds. Community-wide speed reduction strategies intervene in the built environment to slow down motor vehicles and are systematically applied within a defined geographic area.

Through a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MAPC partnered with Health Resources in Actoin (HRiA) to develop an evidence-based resource for speed reduction strategies, including designing and retrofitting road networks to ensure safe speeds, using automated traffic enforcement technologies, and reducing speed limits.

This is the perfect time for Middleton to implement a first ever health design chapter into the plan. Middleton has been one of the fastest growing towns in Massachusetts over the past 20 years. With that in perspective, the Town has been growing but the infrastructure has not traditionally been built with public health in mind related to physical activity, active living (especially for the aging), and access to healthier food. The Middleton Board of Health and MHD set a vision to improve public health in these areas and implement the aforementioned programs and initiatives.

Description:
The Fairmount Indigo Planning Initiative was a three-year BRA study begun in February 2012 by the City of Boston. The planning initiative looked at short and long term strategies for improving capital investment, public realm improvements and job access along the 9.2 mile Fairmount Indigo commuter rail line, which links South Station to Readville, crossing through Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan, and Hyde Park. The initiative is the BRA’s largest planning study to date and will impact 132,000 residents who live within a half-mile of the commuter rail line. The study identified corridor wide opportunities for commercial and residential development, transit access, public realm enhancements, and community building initiatives.

The MassDOT project will replace existing highway ramps with an urban interchange and street system that will facilitate the ultimate redevelopment of Beacon Park Yards – a former rail yard – into a (currently undefined) mixed-use development. Harvard University owns the majority of the land within the project study area, but has not yet proposed plans for its future development. The ultimate buildout of the area is expected to be of significant size and scope, and MassDOT, the Cities of Boston and Cambridge, and the Town of Brookline would all like to maximize the future use of non-auto forms of transportation for trips that start or end in Beacon Park Yards, and for regional trips that travel through Allston to access major employment centers in Harvard Square, Kendall Square, Longwood Medical Area, and Downtown Boston.

Included in the interchange project is the addition of a multi-modal bus and commuter rail station within Beacon Park Yards referred to as “West Station.” MassDOT and MBTA are committing to designing and building the West Station, with financial support from area property owners, once development of a sufficient amount to warrant its utility occurs in Beacon Park Yards and nearby population and employment centers . 

The purpose of MAPC's West Station Area Transit study is to provide municipal and state government, as well as the development community, with an objective evaluation of the strategies that could best improve non-auto accessibility to jobs, labor, housing, healthcare, and other major destinations under different potential development futures for the Beacon Park Yards area. The results of this study will help municipal and state governments to proactively plan for and implement regional mobility improvements as Beacon Park Yards and surrounding areas are developed. A direct outcome of this Study will be transit service concepts that MassDOT can use to inform the design of the new West Station so it supports the type of transit service that will meet the accessibility and non-auto mode share goals identified by this study. 

Study Questions:
• Which transit connections and service levels might attract the most riders?
• What is the best sequencing of development and transit improvements?
• How might pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, as well as on-demand mobility services, impact travel behavior?

The purpose of the shuttle would be to better connect the residents of North Reading to MBTA services, which also potentially connecting workers to jobs in North Reading. Finally, a shuttle service could provide relief for overcrowded parking at the Wilmington or Reading stations. The study will examine the existing commuting trends for North Reading, to determine whether the data show that connecting to commuter rail via satellite parking site might be warranted now or be needed in future. The study will also review and rank locations in North Reading for a park and ride lot,  based upon information such as ownership, possible lease, and maintenance costs, distance to commuter rail and overall accessibility for the town residents. The study will include a range of potential ridership, based upon similar satellite shuttles operations in the Boston region. Finally, the study will include potential construction costs for the satellite lot, based upon other recent parking construction and lease costs in the area, as well as possible shuttle operating costs, using data from similar operations in the region. 

Previous plans and studies that recognized the need for better transit include the Town’s 2004 Master Plan, which identified a lack of public transportation and paratransit as a problem in the Town; a recent survey conducted by the Boston North Regional Coordinating Council which identified North Reading as having particularly difficult transportation challenges, as well as the 2017 North Reading senior and paratransit study. Additionally, the North Suburban Planning Council through the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) completed a suburban mobility study to address the transportation needs of all residents. This study will complement the larger subregional project.

The research is looking at whether the VMT changes are part of shift in overall travel behavior with more drivers and greater auto ownership with economic growth, or is mostly an effect of more ride-hailing services and food/parcel deliveries. Similarly, congestion pricing has been implemented in several highway corridors in the US and in urban areas across the globe as a way to make vehicular traffic more efficient, minimize air and noise quality impacts of vehicular traffic, and raise revenues for transportation infrastructure.

Improving transportation connections along the corridor will increase access to employment, educational opportunities, and healthcare for economically disadvantaged individuals, middle skilled workers, high school and college students, recent college graduates, and other members of the workforce. Greater use of public transit would help alleviate traffic congestion, improve air quality, and reduce wear and tear on the roadway network.

The communities of Billerica, Chelmsford, Lowell, Tewksbury and Tyngsborough fall within the Lowell Regional Transit Authority’s service area, while the communities of Burlington, Bedford and Lexington are within the MBTA’s service area.

installed temporary street improvements on Main Street, Nason Street, and Summer Street in late July 2016. The pilot project’s goal was to
demonstrate ways that the roadways could be redesigned to be more welcoming to all users. The temporary configuration utilized materials
